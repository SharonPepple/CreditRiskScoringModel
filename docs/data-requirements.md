Data Requirements for Credit Risk Scoring Model Project

As part of defining the scope and objectives of this Credit Risk Scoring Model project, it is essential to document and clearly outline the data requirements. This document specifies the necessary data, its sources, access methods, processing needs, and storage details. It also addresses quality, security, and privacy standards to ensure compliance and maintain the integrity of the data. Properly defining these requirements helps to understand the scope, complexity, and governance surrounding the data used in this project.

1. Data Needs and Sources
Required Data:
The data required for this project includes client demographic information, financial attributes, loan history, and repayment behavior. Specifically, this includes fields such as client ID, age, income, credit score, loan amount, payment status, and default indicators.
Data Source:
The dataset for this project is custom-made to simulate real-world client credit profiles. While no real-world data is used, the dataset mirrors typical loan application data from financial institutions. Data is created manually and validated for accuracy.

2. Data Access and Processing
Data Access:
The dataset is stored locally in CSV format and can be accessed using Python libraries such as Pandas. For larger-scale deployments, the dataset could be stored in cloud-based solutions (e.g., Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3) and accessed via APIs or SQL queries for scalability.
Data Processing:
Data will be preprocessed to ensure it meets the quality standards necessary for model development. This includes:
Handling missing values.
Normalizing or standardizing continuous variables (e.g., income, loan amount).
Encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender, employment status).
Feature engineering, if necessary, to create new insights or variables.

3. Data Storage
Current Storage:
The data is currently stored as a flat file (CSV) for ease of use and testing in Python. The file is version-controlled using GitHub to ensure trackability and ease of collaboration.
Potential Future Storage Solutions:
If the project scales, a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or cloud storage solutions would be used to store and query the data efficiently.

4. Data Quality Requirements
To ensure the integrity of the analysis, the following data quality standards must be met:
Accuracy:
All financial figures (e.g., income, loan amounts) must reflect realistic values, and any manually generated data should be cross-validated for logical consistency.
Completeness:
All mandatory fields must be filled (e.g., Client_ID, Credit_Score, Loan_Default), and missing values should be handled appropriately (e.g., through imputation or removal).
Consistency:
Consistent data formats must be used, such as two decimal places for monetary values, and standardized date formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
Uniqueness:
Each Client_ID must be unique to ensure that no duplicate client profiles exist in the dataset.
Validity:
Values must fall within valid ranges (e.g., credit scores between 300 and 850) and follow business rules (e.g., no negative income).

5. Security and Privacy Compliance
Even though this dataset is custom-made and uses fictional data, it is still important to treat it as if it contains sensitive information. The following measures will be applied:
Security:
The dataset will be stored in a secure repository (GitHub with private repository settings, or local storage with encryption) to prevent unauthorized access.
Privacy:
No personally identifiable information (PII) is used. However, if real-world data is incorporated in future iterations, data privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA must be followed.

6. Data Integration and Transformation
Integration:
As the data is custom-generated, no external data sources are integrated at this stage. However, future iterations may include data from additional sources, such as third-party credit bureaus or financial institutions, requiring proper ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
Transformation:
The raw data will undergo transformation steps, including feature scaling, outlier treatment, and encoding of categorical variables to ensure it is suitable for machine learning algorithms.

7. Data Governance
Version Control:
The dataset will be version-controlled through GitHub, allowing changes and updates to be tracked systematically.
Ownership:
As the dataset is self-created, it is maintained under open-source licensing, allowing use for educational or project purposes.

This Data Requirements Document helps outline the scope of data handling for the Credit Risk Scoring Model, ensuring clarity on how the data will be accessed, processed, stored, and governed, while also maintaining quality, security, and compliance standards.
